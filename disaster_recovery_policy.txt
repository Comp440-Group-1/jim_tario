Disaster Recovery Plan(DRP) 
The plan must take into account : sensitivity of data, data loss tolerance, required availability, etc. 

The plan can be based on few a solutions:
-Failover clustering
	This option reduces down time since a fail safe is put in place to take over if database goes down
-Database mirroring
	Minimize data loss and have very good availability
-Replication
-Log shipping
-Backup and restore
	Backup should be stored in an off-site location, different type of backups can be implemented (full, differential, partial)


For the purpose of this project Backup and Restore and Database Mirroring are viable choices. Cloud services and owned hardware can allow a solid DRP.

DRP Policy (effective immediately):

Plan #1: Full Backup

Description: Perform full backup on all system databases

Schedule: Occurs on a bi-weekly basis Mondays at 12:00 AM

Step 1. Integrity Check

Step 2: Perform full backup 

---------------------------------

Plan #2: Differential Backup 

Description: Perform differential backup on all databases

Schedule: Occurs every day every 12 hours between 6:00 AM and 11:59 PM

Step 1. Perform backup
